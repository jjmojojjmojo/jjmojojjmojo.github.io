<h2>WARNING</h2>
  You are viewing a <strong>draft</strong> document. It may contain inaccurate, misleading, or unvetted information.
  </div>
<div class="entry-content status-draft">
<p>A few basic concepts I've found essential in getting great work done
<em>fast</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="get-better-requirements-up-front">
<h2 id="get-better-requirements-up-front">Get Better Requirements Up Front</h2>
<p>Ask the tough questions. Focus on driving out uncertainty, and testing
assumptions.</p>
<p>The more effective you are at doing this, the less trouble you will have
down the road.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="get-organized">
<h2 id="get-organized">Get Organized</h2>
<p>Start recording and organizing requirements as they come in, and
maintain your project documents in as orderly a fashion as possible.</p>
<p>This may mean using a lot of paper in a binder, keeping journals, or
using project management software.</p>
<p>Yes, it's extra work, but it's necessary to avoid miscommunication and
prevent missed commitments (among other things).</p>
<p>Keep the organizational work from bogging down your project by picking a
method that's easy for you to get into.</p>
<p>Then focus on getting really, really good at it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="get-sign-off">
<h2 id="get-sign-off">Get Sign Off</h2>
<p>Take the requirements you get from your stakeholders, reformat them,
reinterpret them, and present them for approval.</p>
<p>Typically, this will start a dialog that will lead to better
requirements, and solidify the relationship you have with your
stakeholders.</p>
<p>Worst case, they sign off without reading it, and you have 'rear-end
coverage' in the event expectations aren't met.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="break-down-the-walls">
<h2 id="break-down-the-walls">Break Down The Walls</h2>
<p>Resist the comfort of 'buffers' between you and your stakeholders and/or
users.</p>
<p>Dealing as directly as you can with the people who your work will affect
the most:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>avoids unrealistic expectations</li>
<li>prevents false starts</li>
<li>limits rework</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it means a shorter time to 'done', and happier stakeholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="work-iteratively">
<h2 id="work-iteratively">Work Iteratively</h2>
<p>Prototype, refine, re-refine, prototype some more, refine, re-refine,
<em>ad infinitum</em>.</p>
<p>Build just enough to meet the requirements, and then build more.
Refactor liberally.</p>
<p>Further, don't focus too much on polishing your work too early in the
project. Start with quick proof of concept prototypes - move code from
prototypes into modules as it matures, and add unit tests along the way.</p>
<p>It's important to vet your engineering and design decisions early on to
keep refactoring 'cheap'.</p>
<p>As the project comes into focus, your APIs begin to settle, your
namespaces take shape - then concentrate on kick-ass test coverage,
modularization, code organization, DRY, packaging, and other
refinements. The end result will be highly refined, well vetted units of
code that can more effectively be replaced or reworked.</p>
<p><em>Lather, rinse, repeat.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="utilize-design-patterns">
<h2 id="utilize-design-patterns">Utilize Design Patterns</h2>
<p><em>I sleep with the `GoF
book &lt;http://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612&gt;`__
under my pillow at night.</em></p>
<p>Seriously, design patterns are not a magic bullet, but remember why they
exist - because software is repetitive.</p>
<p>I've found the hardest part of any project is not writing the code. The
real challenge is <em>engineering the solution</em>.</p>
<p>Design patterns lay out a foundation of practical approaches that have
been tested both intellectually and practically, over time. They help us
articulate a software problem - they act as a sort of <em>solution
vocabulary</em>.</p>
<p>Building up a solution out of a series of design patterns means less
engineering work, less communication parity between developers, and
fewer engineering 'near misses'.</p>
<p>Also, don't forget there are design patterns in other areas besides OOP
work - and sometimes, they're not called 'design patterns'.&nbsp; For
example, check out this repository of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/">Enterprise Data
Models</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="communicate-effectively">
<h2 id="communicate-effectively">Communicate Effectively</h2>
<p>Absolute transparency coupled with free-flowing communication is
essential to a healthy project... <em>assuming that your stakeholders
actually understand what you're doing</em> :)</p>
<p>It's important to channel information in constructive ways, and tailor
it to your audience.</p>
<p>You can avoid unnecessary re-work, bad requirements, and slow downs
because of misunderstandings if you find ways to communicate completely,
but <em>effectively</em>.</p>
<p>I like to send out periodic status reports, and keep in mind who will be
reading them. But remember, this isn't about <em>spin</em> - it's about simple
communication. Find ways to do it effectively, regardless of the
underlying message, and you will get things done faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="find-your-community">
<h2 id="find-your-community">Find Your Community</h2>
<p>Some of the biggest road blocks to getting a project completed are
purely <em>mental</em>.</p>
<p>We paint ourselves into a corner, we become unsure about engineering
decisions we've made previously, we get stuck on a problem we just can't
seem to work out.</p>
<p>Building a human infrastructure of cultural and engineering support can
be one of the biggest efficiencies you can gain as a programmer.</p>
<p>Find a community of similar individuals. This may mean other developers
at your organization, local user groups, IRC channels - be creative. The
similarities might be surprising - usually that means similar languages,
industries, domains, or platforms, but that's not the case all of the time.
Don't be afraid to seek out <em>non-technical</em> connections.</p>
<p>Keep in touch with coworkers from past jobs. Utilize social media,
<a class="reference external" href="http://freenode.net/">IRC</a> and sites like
<a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> to present questions to a
broad audience.</p>
<p>But never forget to return the favor. Keep a blog and update it
frequently. Answer other people's questions on IRC. Building a
reputation for being helpful will help you get help more... um...
<em>helpfully</em>. The more help you can get, the less time you'll spend in
mental quagmires, and the more efficient you can become.</p>
