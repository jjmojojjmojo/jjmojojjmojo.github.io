<div class="entry-content status-draft">
<p>I've always been handy with hardware. I was one of "those kids" you hear
about that keeps taking things apart just to see how they work - and
driving their parents nuts in the process. When I was a teenager, I
toyed with programming but didn't get serious with it until I decided I
wanted to get into graphic design. I found out that you don't have to
write HTML yourself, you can use programming to do it for you!</p>
<p>But I never stopped tinkering with hardware and systems. I used Linux
and BSD on my desktop for years, built my LAMP stacks from source, and
simulated the server environment when I couldn't - when I used windows
for work, and when I eventually adopted Apple as my primary platform, I
first started with cross-compiled versions of the components, and
eventually got into virtualization.</p>
<p>In the early days (maybe 10 years ago) there seemed to be few
programmers who were like me, or if they were, they never took
"operations" or "sysadmin" jobs, and neither did I. So there was always
a natural divide. Aside from being a really nice guy who everyone likes,
I had a particular rapport with my cohorts who specialized in systems.</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly what it was. It may have been that I was always
interested in the finer details of how a system works. It may have been
my tendency to document things meticulously, or my interest in
automation and risk reduction. It could have just been that I was
willing to take the time to cross the divide and talk to them, even when
I didn't need something. It may have just boiled down to the fact that
when they were busy, I could do things myself, and I wanted to follow
their standards, and get their guidance. It's hard to tell, even today,
as my systems skills have developed beyond what they ever were before,
but the rapport has continued on.</p>
<p>And then something happened. As my career progressed, I took on more
responsibilities and did more and more systems work. This was partly
because of the divide widening to some extent at one particular job, but
mostly because, <em>I could</em>. Right around this time the "DevOps
Revolution" was beginning.</p>
<p>Much like when I was a teenager and everyone <em>needed</em> a web site,
suddenly everyone <em>needed</em> DevOps.</p>
<p>I didn't really know what it was. I was aware of the term, but being a
smart person, I tend to ignore radical claims of great cultural shifts,
especially in technology. In this stance, I find myself feeling a step
or two behind at times, but it helps keep things in perspective. Over
time, technology changes, but true radicalism is rare. Most often, a
reinvention or revisiting of past ideas forms the basis for such claims.
This "DevOps" thing was no different. Honestly, at the time it seemed
like a smoke screen; a flashy way to save money for startups.</p>
<p>I got sick of tending systems - when you're doing it <em>properly</em>, it can
be a daunting task. Dealing with storage, access control, backups,
networking, high availability, maintenance, security, and all of the
domain-specific aspects can easily become overwhelming. But worse, I was
doing too much front-line support, which honestly, at the time was more
important than the programming it was distracting me from. I love my
users, and I see their success as my success. I didn't mind it, but the
bigger problems I wanted to solve were consistently being held above my
head, just out of my grasp. I could ignore my users or ignore my
passion, and that was a saddening conundrum. I felt like all of the
creativity I craved was gone, and I was being paid too much (or too
little depending on if you think I was an over paid junior sysadmin or
an under paid IT manager with no authority) to work under such tedium.
So I changed jobs.</p>
<p>I made the mistake of letting my new employer decide where they wanted
me to go in the engineering organization.</p>
<p>What I didn't know about this new company was that it had been under
some cultural transition just prior to bringing me on board. Part of
that culture shift was incorporating so-called "DevOps" into the mix. By
fiat or force.</p>
<p>Because of my systems experience, I landed on the front line of that
fight: the "DevOps Team". I wasn't happy.</p>
<p>But as I dug in, I saw some potential. We had the chance to really shore
up the development practices, reduce risk in deployments, make the
company more agile, and ultimately make more money.</p>
<p>We had edicts to make things happen, under the assumption that if we
built it, the developers would embrace it. These things included
continuous integration, migrating from subversion to git, building and
maintaining code review tools, and maintaining the issue tracking
system. We had other, less explicit responsibilities that became central
to our work later on, including developer support, release management,
and interfacing with the separate, segregated infrastructure department.
This interaction was especially important, since we had no systems of
our own, and we weren't allowed to administer any machines. We didn't
have privileged access to any of the systems we needed to maintain for a
long time.</p>
<p>With all the hand wringing and flashing of this "DevOps" term, I dug in
and read about it, and what all the hubub was about. I then realized
something. What we were doing <em>wasn't DevOps</em>.</p>
<p>Then I realized something else. <em>I was DevOps</em>. I always had been. The
culture was baked into the kind of developer I was. Putting me, and
other devs with similar culture on a separate team, whether that was the
"DevOps" team or the infrastructure team was a fundamental mistake.</p>
<p>The developers didn't come around. At one point someone told a teammate
of mine that they thought we were "IT support". What needed to happen
was the developers had to embrace the concept that they were capable of
doing at least some systems things themselves, in safe and secure
manner, and the infrastructure team had to let them do it. But my team
just sat there in the middle, doing what we could to keep the lights on
and get the code out, but ultimately just wasting our time. Some
developers starting using AWS, with the promise of it being a temporary
solution, but in a vacuum nonetheless. We were not having the impact
that management wanted us to have.</p>
<p>My time at this particular company ended in a coup of sorts. This story
is worthy of a separate blog post some day when it hurts a little less
to think about. But lets just say I was on the wrong side of the
revolution and left as quickly as I could when it was over.</p>
<p>In my haste, I took another "DevOps" job. My manager there assured me
that it would be a programming job first, and a systems job second. "We
need more 'dev' in our 'devops'", he told me.</p>
<p>What happened was very similar to my previous "DevOps" experience, but
more acute. Code, and often requirements, were thrown over the wall at
the last minute. As it fell in our laps, we scrambled to make it work,
and work properly, as it seemed no one would think of things like fail
over or backups or protecting private information when they were making
their plans. Plans made long ago, far away, and without our help.</p>
<p>This particular team was more automation focused. We had two people who
were more "dev" than "ops", and the operations people were no slouches
when it came to scripting or coding in their own right.</p>
<p>It was a perfect blend, and as a team we got along great and pulled off
some miracles.</p>
<p>But ultimately, we were still isolated. We, and our managers tried to
bridge the gap to no avail. Developers, frustrated with our sizable
backlog, went over our heads to get access to our infrastructure and
started doing it for themselves, often with little or no regard for our
policies or practice. We would be tasked with cleaning up their mess
when it was time for production deployment - typically in a major hurry
after the deadline had passed.</p>
<p>The original team eventually evaporated. I was one of the last to leave,
as new folks were brought into a remote office. I stuck it out for a lot
of reasons: I was promised transfer to NYC, I had good healthcare, I
loved my team. But ultimately what made me stick around was the hope,
that kept getting rebuilt and dashed as management rotated in and out
above me, that we could make it work.</p>
<p>I took the avenue of providing automated tools to let the developers
have freedom to do as they pleased, yet we could ensure they were
complying with company security guidelines and adhering to sane
operations practices.</p>
<p>Sadly, politics and priorities kept my vision from coming to reality.
It's OK, in hindsight, because so much more was broken about so-called
"DevOps" at this particular company. I honestly don't think that it
could have made that much of a difference.</p>
<p>Near the end of my tenure there, I tried to help some of the developers
help themselves by sitting with them and working out how to deploy their
code properly side-by-side. It was a great collaboration, but it fell
short. It represented a tiny fraction of the developers we supported.
Even with those really great developers finally interfacing with my
team, it was too little, too late.</p>
<p>Another lesson learned: <em>you can't force cultural change.</em> It has to
start from the bottom up, and it needs breathing room to grow.</p>
<p>I had one final "DevOps" experience before I put my foot down and made
the personal declaration that <em>"DevOps is bullshit"</em>, and I wasn't going
to do it anymore.</p>
<p>Due to the titles I had taken, and the experiences of the last couple of
years, I found myself in a predicament. I was seen by recruiters as a
"DevOps guy" and not as a programmer. It didn't matter that I had 15
years of programming experience in several languages, or that I had
focused on programming even in these so-called "DevOps" jobs. All that
mattered was that, as a "DevOps Engineer" I could be easily packaged for
a high-demand market.</p>
<p>I went along with the type casting for a couple of reasons. First, as I
came to realize, <em>I am DevOps</em> - if anyone was going to come into a
company and bridge the gap between operations and engineering, it'd be
me. Even if the company had a divide, which <em>every company I interviewed
with had</em>, I might be able to come on board and change things.</p>
<p>But there was a problem. At least at the companies I interviewed at, it
seemed that "DevOps" really meant "operations and automation" (or more
literally "AWS and configuration management"). The effect this had was
devastating. The somewhat superficial nature of parts of my systems
experience got in the way of landing some jobs I would have been great
at. I was asked questions about things that had never been a problem for
me in 15 years of building software and systems to support it, and being
unable to answer, but happy to talk through the problem, would always
end in a net loss.</p>
<p>When I would interview at the few programming jobs I could find or the
recruiters would give me, they were never for languages I knew well. And
even when they were, my lack of computer science jargon bit me - hard. I
am an extremely capable software engineer, someone who learns quickly
and hones skills with great agility. My expertise is practical, however,
and it seemed that the questions that needed to be asked, that would
have illustrated my skill, weren't. I think to them, I looked like a guy
who was sick of systems that was playing up their past dabbling in
software to change careers.</p>
<p>So it seemed "DevOps", this great revolution, and something that was
baked into my very identity as a programmer, had left me in the dust.</p>
<p>I took one final "DevOps" job before I gave up. I was optimistic, since
the company was growing fast and I liked everyone I met there. Sadly, it
had the same separations, and was subject to the same problems. The
developers, who I deeply respected, were doing their own thing, in a
vacuum. My team was unnecessarily complicating everything and wasting
huge amounts of time. Again, it was just "ops with automation" and
nothing more.</p>
<p>So now lets get to the point of all of this. We understand why I might
think "DevOps is bullshit", and why I might not want to do it anymore.
But what does that really mean? How can my experiences help you, as a
developer, as an operations person, or as a company with issues they
feel "DevOps" could address?</p>
<p><strong>Don't *do* DevOps</strong>. It's that simple. <em>Apply</em> the practices and
technology that comprise what DevOps is to your development process, and
stop putting up walls between different specialties.</p>
<p>A very wise man once said "If you have a DevOps team, <em>you're doing it
wrong</em>". If you start doing that, <strong>stop it</strong>.</p>
<p>There is some nuance here, and my experience can help save you some
trouble by identifying some of the common mistakes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>DevOps doesn't make specialists obsolete.</li>
<li>Developers can learn systems and operations, but nothing beats
experience.</li>
<li>Operations people can learn development too, but again, nothing beats
experience.</li>
<li>Operations and development have historically be separated for a
reason - there are compromises you must make if you integrate the
two.</li>
<li>Tools and automation are <em>not enough</em>.</li>
<li>Developers have to <em>want</em> DevOps. Operations have to <em>want</em> DevOps.
<strong>At the same time.</strong></li>
<li>Using "DevOps" to save money by reducing staff will <em>blow up in your
face</em>.</li>
<li>You can't have DevOps and still have separate operations and
development teams. <strong>Period.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Let me stop for one moment and share another lesson I've learned: <em>if it
ain't broke, don't fix it</em>.</p>
<p>If you have a working organization that seems old fashioned, <strong>leave it
alone</strong>. It's possible to incorporate the tech, and even some of the
cultural aspects of DevOps without radically changing how things work -
it's just <em>not DevOps anymore</em>, so don't call it that. Be critical of
your process and practices, <em>kaizen</em> and all that, but don't sacrifice
what works just to join the cargo cult. You will waste money, and you
will destroy morale. The pragmatic operations approach is the happiest
one.</p>
<p>Beware of <em>geeks</em> bearing gifts.</p>
<p>So lets say you know why you want DevOps, and you're certain that the
cultural shift is what's right for your organization. Everyone is
excited about it. What might a proper "DevOps" team look like?</p>
<p>I can speak to this, because I currently work in one.</p>
<p>First, never call it "DevOps". It's just what you do as part of your
job. Some days you're writing code, other days you're doing a
deployment, or maintenance. Everyone shares all of those
responsibilities equally.</p>
<p>People still have areas of experience and expertise. This isn't pushing
people into a luke-warm, mediocre dilution of their skills - this is
passionate people doing what they love. It's just that part of that, is
launching a server or writing a chef recipe or debugging a production
issue.</p>
<p>As such you get a truly cross functional team. Where expertise differs,
first, there's a level of respect and trust. So if someone knows more
about a topic than someone else, they will likely be the authority on
it. The rest of the team trusts them to steer the group in the right
direction.</p>
<p>This means that you can <em>hire operations people</em> to join your team. Just
don't give them exclusive responsibility for what they're best at -
integrate them. The same goes for any "non deveoper" skillset, be that
design, project managment or whatever.</p>
<p>Beyond that, everyone on the team has a thirst to develop new skills and
look at their work in different ways. This is when the difference in
expertise provides an opportunity to teach. Teaching brings us closer
together and helps us all gain better understanding of what we're doing.</p>
<p>So that's what DevOps really is. You take a bunch of really skilled,
passionate, talented people who don't have their heads shoved so far up
their own asses that they can take the time to learn new things. People
who see the success of the business as a combined responsibility that is
eqully shared. "That's not my job" is not something they are prone to
saying, but they're happy to delegate or share a task if need be. You
give them the infrastructure, and time (and encouragement doesn't hurt),
to build things in a way that makes the most sense for their
productivity, and the business, embracing that equal, shared sense of
responsibility. Things like continuous integration and zero-downtime
deployments <em>just happen</em> as a function of smart, passionate people
working toward a shared goal.</p>
<p>It's an organic, culture-driven process. We may start doing continuous
deployment, or utlize "the cloud" or treat our "code as infrastructure"
but only if it makes sense. The developers are the operations people and
the operations people are the developers. An application system is seen
in a holistic manner and developed as a single unit. No one is
compromising, we all get better as we all <em>just fucking do it</em>.</p>
<p>DevOps is indeed bullshit. What matters is good people working together
without artificial boundaries. Tech is tech. It's not possible for
everyone to share like this, but when it works, it's amazing - but is it
really DevOps? I don't know, I don't do <em>that</em> anymore.</p>
