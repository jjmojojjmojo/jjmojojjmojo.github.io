<h2>Concensus Is Bad</h2>
<p>A common source of angst for engineering teams is trying to come to a consensus.</p>
<p>A consensus is considered a higher state of being for a team - now we can move forward with confidence, we're all on the same page.</p>
<p>Getting there can be difficult. Its especially true when there is a mix of expertise and experience in the group. It's downright <em>acute</em> when the goals or motivations of the team members are at odds.</p>
<p>This difficulty brings fatigue. It convinces people that team discussions are a waste of time, simply because consensus is hard to achieve.</p>
<p>What's worse, is that often what looks like consensus on the surface is, in reality, a fascist dictatorship. One or a small number of people have just broken down the rest through sheer force of will. Or, more timid folks decide to &quot;go with the flow&quot;, even if they haven't been heard and disagree with the consensus. It gets really bad when the pressure to give up and agree has more to do with intimidation and less to do with a good argument.</p>
<p>So I <em>hate</em> consensus. I think it's a waste of time. What I prefer to do is seek <em>buy in</em>. We don't all have to agree, but we should all be comfortable with the general direction that has emerged through discussion and debate. What really needs to be discussed are any <em>objections</em> to a proposed course of action. Typically with any given technical decision, there is someone who has more experience with the problem domain, or better understands the customer's needs. My approach is to trust that person. It's their job to explain their thoughts well, sure, but when we disagree, I trust that they are not trying to do anything bad. That's ultimately what we need to care about: it's not about making a decision that is perfectly agreed upon by everyone in the room. We want to avoid risk and be efficient.</p>
<p>Further, it's about making sure that everyone is heard, and that concerns are addressed. Once we've achieved that, even if there are people vehemently against the course of action, there's not much reason for them to object. So instead, we make sure all concerns are addressed, and we trust that the people with the best idea, or the domain expert, or whatever, made their case because they care about solving the problem. We trust that they wouldn't suggest something that would hurt us for the sake of their vanity.</p>
