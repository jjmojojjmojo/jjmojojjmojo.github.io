<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Developing a sane and productive workflow is essential to increasing productivity and minimizing risk. Good testing discipline coupled with regimented use of a revision control system is key. The workflow outlined in this guide is the result of many years of experience and discussion of best practices. It is not comprehensive in the sense of total maximization of productivity or utter elimination of risk. Frankly, that's just not possible. Instead we lay the groundwork for more robust practices, like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration" target="external">continuous integration</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment" target="external">continuous deployment</a>.</p>
<p>This guide <em>is</em>,  however, comprehensive in that it attempts to answer all of the basic questions that developers face when collaborating on large code bases.</p>
<p>The workflow is presented using a non-trivial (but necessarily simplistic) example application as a framing device. It is designed to be easy to reason about, and show general good practices. However, it is <em>not</em> optimized or robust. We will discuss areas where we might improve on these aspects, but they're really out of scope for this guide.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p class="last">This workflow is a simplified version of the one outlined in the classic <a class="reference external" href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="external">A successful Git branching model</a> by Vincent Driessen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-example-application">
<h2 id="the example application">The Example Application</h2>
<p>For our example, we'll be building on a simple HTTP API endpoint, implemented in Python 3. This endpoint's primary function is to return a random quote from a pool of quotes previously stored in a database.</p>
<p>The application is built using as few external dependencies as possible, but for added realism, uses a few libraries to handle some of the messier bits.</p>
<div class="section" id="limitations-and-design-restrictions">
<h3>Limitations and Design Restrictions</h3>
<p>The goal of the example application is to provide as realistic a codebase as possible. But there are good reasons to put some simple restrictions on the end product:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Keeping scope in check.</strong> The application should be easy to reason about. If it were to be too complex, like a real-life code base might be, we'd spend too much time explaining the implementation of the features and bug fixes.</li>
<li><strong>Comfort of the audience.</strong> The author hopes that this guide is useful to programmers of all levels of expertise. As such, it's important that the concepts are easy to understand and explain.</li>
<li><strong>Reducing dependencies (code and infrastructure)</strong> We could treat this application as a production-ready project, utilizing a highly optimized web framework, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" target="external">ORM</a>, enterprise-level database, and deploy the whole thing to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service" target="external">PAAS</a>. However, there's a strong desire to allow any reader, with minimal configuration, to jump in and benefit. Design and technical decisions are made with this in mind.</li>
<li><strong>Be as generic as possible</strong> While we're using a specific database, we are generally adhering to well-known standards like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface" target="external">WSGI</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/" target="external">DBAPI</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol" target="external">HTTP</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="external">REST</a>. This should make the application useful as a good example of a generic web application.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practical terms, this means that the application will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use as few dependencies as possible.</li>
<li>Use a bundled database product (we're using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sqlite.org/index.html" target="external">sqllite3</a>).</li>
<li>Require no other tooling beyond a console (terminal), git, python 3 and some sort of text editor.</li>
</ul>
<p>One additional area where the design is being restricted is <em>error handling</em>. Avoiding input verification and exception handling helps keep the code simple.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparation">
<h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
<p>Before we begin, you should do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git" target="external">Install git</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="external">Install python 3</a></li>
<li>Make sure <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html" target="external">venv</a> is installed (it should be, but some Linux distributions put it in a separate package)</li>
</ol>
<p>From there, you'll have all the tools you need, save a preferred text editor and a console (or terminal) to follow along.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Note</h2>
<p class="last">The guide has been developed with unix-like systems in mind (Linux, BSD, MacOS). It should be possible to follow along in Windows, but this has not been tested. There are some quirks to using git and python in Windows that the author would like to explore in the future. If you are interested in seeing this guide include Windows-specific notes, please <a class="reference external" href="/pages/contact.html">contact the author</a>.</p>

<p class="caption">High-level overview of the workflow, showing each git command.</p>
</div>
<p>The basic workflow goes like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><code>git clone</code> the repository (or <code>git pull</code> changes into an existing clone).</li>
<li>Check out the branch you want to work from (usually <code>master</code>).</li>
<li>Run the tests.</li>
<li>Create a new branch for the bug/feature. (<code>git branch</code>)</li>
<li>Check out the new branch. (<code>git checkout</code>)</li>
<li>Make the changes.</li>
<li>Write tests for your changes.</li>
<li>Increment the revision number. (if applicable)</li>
<li><code>git commit</code> your changes and tests.</li>
<li><code>git fetch</code> changes that others may have made.</li>
<li><code>git rebase</code> to put all of your commits into one log entry and merge your changes.</li>
<li><code>git checkout</code> the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
<li><code>git merge</code> to your feature or bug branch.</li>
<li>Fix any conflicts.</li>
<li>Run the tests.</li>
<li><code>git tag</code> the changes with the new revision number (if applicable)</li>
<li><code>git push</code> the changes to the remote repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll explore each step in detail as we progress through the guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cloning-the-repository">
<h2 id="cloning the repository">Cloning The Repository</h2>
<p>The first step is to clone the initial version of the example application, from my <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jjmojojjmojo/random_quote" target="external">github repository</a>. But because of the stuff we're going to be doing later, this will be a special two-step process.</p>
<p>First, we need to do a <em>bare</em> clone of the repository. This will give us a <a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes" target="external">remote</a>, that isn't <a class="reference external" href="https://www.github.com" target="external">github</a>, that we can clone and work on.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> git clone --bare https://github.com/jjmojojjmojo/random_quote.git random_quote_remote
</pre></div>
<p>Now, instead of cloning my repository from github, we clone <code>random_quote_remote</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">$</span> git clone random_quote_remote random_quote
</pre></div>
<p>Any changes we <code>git push</code> in <code>random_quote</code> will only go to <code>random_quote_remote</code>.</p>

</pre></div>
<div class="explanation section">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<div class="docutils container">
</div>
<p>We have to first change into the directory where we cloned the code.</p>
<p>We invoke <code>venv</code> using the <code>-m</code> (execute this module) command line option to the python interpreter.</p>
<p>To activate the virtual environment, we tell our shell to execute the commands in a file called <code>bin/activate</code>. This sets some environment variables and changes our prompt.</p>
<p>From there, we can use <code>pip</code> as we would in our system, except the packages installed are installed to the virtual environment, instead of the system.</p>
<p>We use two command-line flags of <code>pip</code>:</p>

<p class="caption">Essential API Boundaries</p>
</div>
<p>This is done for a few reasons. Primarily, the concept of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="external">separation of concerns</a>. The <em>concern</em> of the database interaction, the <em>concern</em> of the web interaction, and the <em>concern</em> of the web <em>client</em> are separated by <strong>clear API boundaries</strong>.</p>
<p>By doing this, we isolate code that has to be different by its nature. <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> is concerned with managing and retrieving data in the database. <code>RandomQuoteApp</code> is concerned with interacting with web clients. The web client is completely out of our control (a browser like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" target="external">Firefox</a>, a utility like <a class="reference external" href="https://curl.haxx.se/" target="external">cURL</a>, or another application).</p>
<p>With proper separation, each concern can be optimized for its purpose. <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> can do database interactions in the best possible way - we can employ an <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" target="external">ORM</a> someday, or change exactly how we store the data. <code>RandomQuoteApp</code> will still function, as long as its python API hasn't changed.</p>
<p>In the same vein, we can make <code>RandomQuoteApp</code> the best web application possible - we can implement security, or caching - it can evolve into a socket-based API that doesn't use HTTP at all!</p>
<p>Finally, the concerns of the client are theirs alone. Today we may be building our application for use by a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application" target="external">single page application</a> intended for a browser client. Tomorrow, the random quote service may be used in a network of  <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices" target="external">microservices</a>, where the client will be another service.</p>
<p>We may write console scripts that use the web API via tools like cURL as part of systems automation.</p>
<p>Whatever the client exactly is, it can be the <em>best</em> client for whatever its purpose. As long as the web API is understood by the client, everything keeps working.</p>
<p>This is entirely in terms of functionality. But there are benefits to this separation for us as developers too.</p>
<p>Having well-separated API boundaries means the code behind those boundaries can be much more simplistic.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at two methods that serve similar functions in <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> and <code>RandomQuoteApp</code>, both called <code>get()</code>:</p>

<p>This method, from <code>RandomQuoteApp</code>, accepts a <code>WebOb.Request</code> object. It does a regular-expression search for the quote ID in the path of the request (e.g. <code>/quote/1234</code>).</p>
<p>If there is no ID specified, it makes the router return a 404 "Not Found" response, by raising the <code>HTTPNotFound</code> class as an exception.</p>
<p>It then uses the <code>RandomQuoteManager.get()</code> method, via the <code>manager</code> property, to retrieve the requested quote from the database.</p>
<p>A <code>WebOb.Resoponse</code> object is created, named <code>response</code>.</p>
<p>The returned <code>quote</code> dictionary is processed into a JSON string, and the <code>response</code> object is configured to send the proper <code>Content-Type</code> header, and the JSON string as the response body.</p>
<p>Finally, the <code>response</code> object is returned.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Both of these methods do essentially the same thing - they retrieve a specific quote from the database, identified by its <code>id</code>. The difference is that one accepts the id as a method parameter, and the other extracts it from the HTTP request.</p>
<p>You can imagine these simple methods could be easily combined into <em>one</em> method.</p>
<p>After all, this is primarily a web application, and there's no specific use case right now for someone using the <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> directly. 🤔</p>

<p>This is a bit of a cutup of what would be a new version of the <code>RandomQuoteApp</code>, named <code>BeginningOfAGiantMessApp</code> as a tongue-in cheek commentary on how this would be a bad idea. 😎</p>
<p>We try to root the example in line with the class declaration and constructor of <code>RandomQuoteApp</code> in <code>src/random_quote/wsgi.py</code>.</p>
<p>We'll need to make a database connection in the WSGI app now, so we had to alter the constructor.</p>
<p>The <code>get()</code> code itself is just an amalgam of the other two methods.</p>
</div>
<p>Combining the two methods is pretty straight forward. However, you can see that even with the very simple functionality in this method, things are getting a bit muddy. As the application grows and changes, it will just get worse.</p>
<p>Modifying this amalgam is much more risky. We can very easily break the database code fixing a web API issue and vice-versa. It's hard for two developers to work on this part of the code base concurrently without running into conflicts.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p class="last">We will learn how to deal with that situation, however unlikely, in <a class="reference external" href="{static}/branching-git-with-pytest-3.rst">part 3</a>! 🦄</p>
</div>
<p>But worse, its also harder to <em>test</em>. This may be one of the biggest advantages to putting thought into separation of concerns, and creating sane API boundaries. When testing the nightmare code above, we have to simulate an HTTP request just to make sure the database works, and we need the database functioning to ensure the HTTP stuff functions. This leads to more complex test fixtures and complex object mocking, and ultimately more fragile test suites.</p>
<p>When writing software, its best to keep our units as small as possible and loosely coupled, so they can be easily isolated. Then our tests are simple and reliable.</p>
<p>The core design of this example application takes this to heart.</p>

<h3>Application Design</h3>
<p>The application as it stands for this part of the guide incorporates concepts of separation of concerns as explored in the last section:</p>

<h4>Explanation</h4>
<div class="docutils container">
</div>
<p>This diagram picks up where the last left off. It is again a simplified diagram inspired by UML.</p>
<p>The classes are identified as <span class="underline">underlined</span> text. The modules are noted in the green boxes.</p>
<p>Each public (or relevant) method is listed (methods are suffixed with parenthesis), as is each property.</p>
<p>Here we see the database connectivity and the HTTP client as actors in the relationships.</p>
<p>We also add connections between class properties and the classes or functions that provide them.</p>
</div>
<p>We take the separation of concerns a step further in the complete application design. We've delegated the construction of database connections to a factory function called <code>connection()</code> in the <code>util</code> module. This way there is a <em>single source of truth</em> for what a database connection looks like, and we aren't duplicating the same connection code in multiple places (the benefit of this will become more apparent later on when we add a new feature that uses the database).</p>
<p>In the diagram above you can see how the classes depend on each other:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code>RandomQuoteApp</code> creates a <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> in its constructor, and assigns it to the <code>manager</code> property.</li>
<li><code>RandomQuoteApp</code> and <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> both take database configuration (a filename). <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> uses <code>connection()</code> to create a connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>connection()</code> configures the sqlite connection so all classes that use it will know what to expect.</p>

<p>We've got a <code>quotes</code> table with four main columns:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>This is the unique identifier for each quote, and how they will be located. It is a <em>primary key</em>, and will be automatically filled in with the next-highest value.</dd>
<dt><code>author</code></dt>
<dd>This is the person whom the quote is credited to. It is stored as a text field.</dd>
<dt><code>quote</code></dt>
<dd>The actual quote. Also a text field.</dd>
<dt><code>created</code></dt>
<dd>The date the quote was created. This is stored as a text field, since sqlite doesn't have a dedicated date/time field type. We use the <code>datetime()</code> sqlite function to populate it automatically.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We then have a special column, <code class="bold">rand</code>, that stores a random number. It's generated using the sqlite <code>random()</code> function if it's not specified. We've added an index on this column so it can be sorted efficiently.</p>
<p>Here's the SQL command we're using to generate the table (this is locaed in <code>src/random_quote/schema.sql</code>):</p>

<p>In this example, we've abbreviated the source of <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> a bit so we can focus just on the parts that are relevant to the <code>random()</code> method.</p>
<p>sqlite3 has a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html#random" target="external">random() function</a> as well. It returns integer values between <em>-9223372036854775808</em> and <em>+9223372036854775807</em>.</p>
<p>In our SQL <code>CREATE</code> statement, we're setting the default value of <code>rand</code> to <code>random()</code>. This will invoke the sqlite function if a value isn't specified.</p>

<h3>sqlite3</h3>
<p>sqlite is a robust, but easy to use <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database" target="external">relational database management system</a>. sqlite3 is the latest version.</p>
<p>sqlite provides the concept of <em>tables</em> containing <em>rows</em> of structured information.</p>
<p>As opposed to other RDBMS', like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="external">PostgreSQL</a>, sqlite does not its own server, and cannot be easily shared across machines. Sqlite was chosen for the example project because Python has a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html" target="external">built-in sqlite3 library</a>.</p>

<h3>WSGI</h3>
<p>Web applications are typically executed by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server" target="external">web servers</a>, like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nginx.com/" target="external">ngnix</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://gunicorn.org/" target="external">gunicorn</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="https://httpd.apache.org/" target="external">apache</a>. This abstracts away the need for application code to handle things like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)" target="external">managing processes</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets" target="external">managing sockets</a>.</p>
<p>To provide that abstraction, web servers support various kinds of <em>gateway interfaces</em>. A common and historically relevant one is the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface" target="external">Common Gateway Interface (CGI)</a>. It essentially calls for the web server to execute a program like a user might on the command line, streams the request on standard in, and reads the response on standard out. Specific environment variables are defined to convey useful information to the program.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p class="last">Reading <a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3875" target="external">RFC3875</a>, where the CGI specification is defined is highly recommended for any web developer.</p>
</div>
<p>CGI had some rough edges and imposed some limitations that made writing web apps with Python a little more cumbersome. In 2003, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-333/" target="external">PEP333</a>  was submitted (and subsequently superseded by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/" target="external">PEP3333</a>), outlining a new way for Python applications to integrate with web servers, that sought to overcome the flaws in CGI.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/" target="external">PEP3333</a> lays out the specification in detail. The basics are that a WSGI application is a Python <em>callable</em> (a function, a class that implements a <code>__call__()</code> method) that takes a few specific parameters (including a dictionary of gateway information inspired by CGI), and then returns an <em>iterable</em> object, containing the body of the response.</p>
<p>We're using <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/webob/en/stable/" target="external">WebOb</a> to handle most of this for us. In <code>RandomQuoteApp</code>, we work with <code>webob.Request</code> objects and return <code>webob.Response</code> objects.</p>

<p>This is one of many ways to have <code>pytest</code> collect and run tests. We're specifying a directory to search for, instead of a module or a specific file.</p>
<p>The output above is illustrative of a successful test run.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initialize-the-database-and-add-some-quotes">
<h2 id="initialize the database and add some quotes">Initialize The Database And Add Some Quotes</h2>
<p>We have utility functions, <code>random_quote.util.init()</code> and <code>random_quote.util.ingest()</code> to create all the tables we need, and insert some quotes to get the database going.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, we'll also use the <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> to add a few unique quotes and show how the API works.</p>
<p>First, lets create a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" target="external">CSV</a> file containing some quotes, called <code>quotes.csv</code>.</p>
<p>You can do this using your favorite spreadsheet program, a text editor, or (recommended) use the provided <code>generate_quotes.py</code> script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> python scripts/generate_quotes.py
</pre></div>
<p>To initialize the database and mess with the API, lets start a python prompt in our virtual environment:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> python

<p>We'll put our database in a file named <code>test.db</code> in the current directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">random_quote</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">util</span>

<p>Now, lets load <code>quotes.csv</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">util</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ingest</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"quotes.csv"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"test.db"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And we can use the <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> to look at what we've loaded:</p>

<span class="go">{"id": 1, "quote":"When I get a little money I buy books; and if any is left, I buy food and clothes.", "author":"Erasmus"...</span>

<p>And we can use it to add a new quote:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">rqm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Something quite quotable"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">1001</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The <code>add()</code> method returns the id of the newly created quote.</p>
<p>Note that the author is <em>optional</em>, and defaults to <code>Unknown</code>:</p>

<h2 id="getting comfortable with git and pytest">Getting Comfortable With Git And Pytest</h2>
<p>As a first step, lets add a new pytest fixture and some test cases. We won't bother doing any branching. This will get us acquainted with how pytest works, and we'll get comfortable with the most basic git commands: <code>git status</code>, <code>git commit</code>, and <code>git push</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pytest-basics">
<h2 id="pytest basics">Pytest Basics</h2>
<p>Pytest uses the concept of  <em>convention over configuration</em> to provide a lot of flexbility when writing tests. All you need to do is provide a python module that has the <code>test_</code> prefix, and fill it with functions that also begin with <code>test_</code>. Pytest will collect these functions and run them for you.</p>
<p>To make a test fail, pytest utilizes the python built-in <code>assert</code> keyword. <code>assert</code> evaluates the given expression, and raises an exception if the expression evaluates to <code>False</code>. Pytest leverages this to make writing tests straight forward: you are simply making <em>assertions</em> about the truth of some expression.</p>

<p>This <em>test suite</em> consists of a single <em>test case</em>, named <code>test_phi()</code>. It has a <em>helper function</em> named <code>phi()</code> that generates <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="external">The Golden Ratio</a>, also known as ϕ.</p>
<p>This test is non-sensical, simply asserting that ϕ != 2.</p>
</div>
<p>As before, we can use <code>pytest</code> to run our test case, but this time we'll specify the file instead of <code>src</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> pytest test_example.py

<p>In this case, only the <code>test_phi()</code> <em>test case</em> is run directly by <code>pytest</code>. The <code>phi()</code> function itself is not.</p>

<p>The next thing you should know is how to write <em>test fixtures</em>. With pytest, fixtures are just specially <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/" target="external">decorated functions</a>.</p>
<p>So what are fixtures for? Fixtures allow us to do some set up work before each test is run, and clean up (or <em>tear down</em>) after. In our <code>random_quote</code> application, it's used to create a database and add some data to it. The database is then destroyed after the test.</p>
<p>Fixtures are decorated with <code>pytest.fixture</code> . To use them in a test, you take a parameter that has the same name. If you <code>return</code> a value, it's passed to the test case. If you <code>yield</code> one, the <code>yield</code> ed value is passed, and control returns to your fixture to clean up after the test.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p>The terms <em>set up</em> and <em>tear down</em> are fundamental automated testing terms. In a lot of other testing frameworks, test suites have special functions or methods with names like <code>setUp</code> and <code>tearDown</code> that provide the same functionality as pytest's fixtures. 🌈</p>
<p class="last">What's cool about pytest, is that fixtures serve the same purpose, but are much more robust. You can change the scope of a fixture by providing the <code>scope</code> keyword argument when decorating a fixture function. <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html#scope-sharing-a-fixture-instance-across-tests-in-a-class-module-or-session" target="external">More details can be found in the documentation</a>.</p>

<p>In this example, we've set up two fixtures to illustrate using <code>yield</code> and <code>return</code>, named <code>yielded_value()</code> and <code>returned_value()</code> respectively.</p>
<p>To show that something has changed due to using the <code>yielded_value()</code> fixture, we set up a global variable, <code>CHANGE_ME</code>. We use the <code>global</code> keyword to allow our fixture to change a value outside of its scope.</p>
<p>The new test suites, <code>test_returned()</code>, <code>test_yielded()</code>, and <code>test_no_fixture()</code> illustrate how fixtures are consumed by test suites.</p>
<p><code>test_yielded()</code> shows that we can use multiple <code>assert</code> statements in one test case if we wish.</p>

</td></tr></table></div><p>You'll note that we have three fixtures defined in this file. The first, <code>temp_db()</code>, creates a temporary file (using the built-in <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tempfile.html" target="external">tempfile</a> module) to store the sqlite database. After it returns the path to the temporary file, when the fixture finishes, it deletes it. This is a perfect example of situations where fixtures are particularly useful.</p>
<p>Next, we have <code>preconfigured_manager()</code>, a fixture that uses the <code>util</code> module to initialize the database, then plain SQL statements to pre-populate it. After returning the <code>RandomQuoteManager</code> object, it closes the connection to ensure it's freed before the next test.</p>
<p>We can see how fixtures can be chained in the same way we use fixtures in test cases, as <code>preconfigured_manager()</code> takes <code>temp_db</code> as a parameter. Multiple fixtures can be used as well, by taking multiple parameters, as illustrated by <code>preconfigured_wsgi_app</code>. Pytest ensures all the cleanup is done in the correct order.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>preconfigured_wsgi_app</code> sets up a <code>WebTest.TestApp</code> instance, wrapping a <code>RandomQuoteApp</code> instance. We aren't using the return value of <code>preconfigured_manager()</code> in <code>preconfigured_wsgi_app()</code>, but we do want the database initialization and data population to be done for us. Even though <code>temp_db</code> is used by both fixtures, it is only called once, ensuring that the database path used by <code>preconfigured_manager()</code> is identical to the one used by <code>preconfigured_wsgi_app()</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the basics of using pytest, lets fill in some missing tests and do our first <code>git commit</code>.</p>

<div class="section" id="something-is-missing-writing-our-first-test-and-fixture">
<h2 id="something is missing! (writing our first test and fixture)">Something Is Missing! (Writing Our First Test and Fixture)</h2>
<p>The last developer who worked on this project (yours truly 😎) has made a pretty big error. We have a good amount of tests, but none of them use the <code>RandomQuoteManager.random()</code> method. It's a big oversight, given that the whole point of this project is to generate random quotes.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p>This is a great reason to look into <em>test coverage analysis</em>, in particular the <a class="reference external" href="https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/" target="external">coverage.py</a> library.</p>
<p class="last">If we were using coverage analysis, we'd have noticed that there was a method that wasn't exercised in the tests.</p>
</div>
<p>We shouldn't be too hard on our predecessor, since they were put into a tough spot. Our quotes are inserted and retrieved using python's built-in psuedo-random number generation tools (the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html" target="external">random</a> module). Every time a function in that module is called (e.g. <code>random.randint()</code>), it will likely produce a different output.</p>
<p>That means that if we were to write a test case for the <code>RandomQuoteManager.random()</code> method, the test case would fail <em>randomly</em> every time it is run. 🤔</p>
<p>Lets see this in action. Here's a test case for <code>RandomQuoteManager.random()</code>, that you should add to the end of <code>src/random_quote/tests/test_manager.py</code>:</p>

<p>So how do we fix this? We alluded to "fixing" the randomness of our code earlier. How is this possible?</p>
<p>There is a <code>seed()</code> function in the <code>random</code> module that <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.seed" target="external">re-initializes the random number generator</a>. It can take a parameter, which is used to provide <em>reproducible</em> randomness.</p>
<p>When used, everything will function properly: if you were to call a random function multiple times under normal circumstances and get a different value, you still would. But the values would be (likely) different, and the same values will be returned. This happens <em>every time</em> that <code>random.seed()</code> is called with the same value.</p>
<p>Here's how that works:</p>

<p>See how the first call to <code>random.randint(0, 10)</code> after <code>random.seed(4)</code> always returns <code>3</code>? This will be the case across machines. Where the initial call returns <code>6</code> for me, it will likely return something else for you. However, once we pass a fixed seed, we get reproducible results.</p>
<p>Lets add a test fixture to the top of <code>src/random_quote/tests/conftest.py</code> that calls <code>random.seed()</code> with a fixed value:</p>

</td></tr></table></div><div class="admonition note">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Note</h2>
<p class="last">We don't actually yield a value here. This is totally acceptable, but in the future we may want to return something that the test cases can use, like the value we used for the seed.</p>
</div>
<p>After the <code>yield</code>, we call <code>random.seed()</code> with no explicit value. That re-seeds the random number generator with the default value, which is the way it normally works (usually it's seeded with the system time).</p>
<p>In order to use this fixture, we just need to pass <code>fix_random</code> as a parameter to <code>preconfigured_manager()</code>. Every test case that uses <code>preconfigured_manager</code>, or any test cases that use fixtures that use <code>preconfigured_manager</code>, will have their randomness "fixed" with the same seed.</p>

<div class="section" id="our-first-git-commit">
<h2 id="our first git commit">Our First <code>git commit</code></h2>
<p>The most basic way to work with <code>git</code> is to make a clone of a repository, make changes on the default branch, usually called <code>master</code>, then <code>git commit</code>, followed by <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p>While it's not best practice to do this most of the time, it's a little less complicated than a fully-baked branch-based development workflow. So we'll take it easy with this first batch of changes, so we can get acquainted with git.</p>
<p>First, we need to ask git what has changed. We do this using <code>git status</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> git status
<span class="go">On branch master</span>
<span class="go">Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.</span>

<span class="go">Changes not staged for commit:</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)</span>

<span class="go">    modified:   src/random_quote/tests/conftest.py</span>
<span class="go">    modified:   src/random_quote/tests/test_manager.py</span>

<span class="go">Untracked files:</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)</span>

<span class="go">    quotes.csv</span>
<span class="go">    test.db</span>
<span class="go">    test_example.py</span>

<span class="go">no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</span>
</pre></div>
<p>One thing you'll notice about git, is that is is very <em>helpful</em> 😎. It tells us which files have been changed, and what to do if we want to <code>git add</code> them to our commit, or remove them (<code>git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>We also see files that we haven't tracked.</p>
<p>Finally, git tells us that there are no changes added to the commit, and we can use <code>git commit -a</code> or <code>git add</code> to change that.</p>
<p>Git has the concept of <em>commits</em>. These are essentially groups of changes (or <em>change sets</em>). This is why the modifications need to be <em>added</em> to the commit. As <code>git status</code> has helpfully stated, we can use <code>git add</code> to add individual changes (or untracked files), or we can use the <code>-a</code> flag to <code>git commit</code> to automatically add any outstanding changes (but leave untracked files alone).</p>
<p>We don't want to add any of these untracked files, but we do want to add all of the changes, so we'll go ahead and use <code>git commit -a</code>.</p>
<p>When this command is executed, git creates a temporary file for us, and will bring up our default editor. Git expects us to provide a <em>commit log message</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p>Usually, the editor is the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/" target="external">vim</a> editor.</p>
<p class="last">You can configure this to be nearly any editor you'd like. <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/associating-text-editors-with-git" target="external">Here are some examples from github</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Our commit messages should be descriptive, but not too long. There's no point in mentioning things that git records in the change set, like which files changed or even which code was altered. Instead, focus on stating <em>why</em> things changed, and the overall <em>point</em> of the commit.</p>
<p>Lets go ahead and execute <code>git commit -a</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> git commit -a

<p>In a git commit message, the first line should be short and give an overview of what was done. The following lines, if any, can provide more detail. We do this chiefly because most git tools only show a truncated version of that first line.</p>

<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p>There is a lot of opinion and different practices revolving around git commit log messages. We've only scratched the surface of what makes a great message, and further, what makes a great <em>commit</em>.</p>
<p class="last">I like the <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages" target="external">git log standard</a> used by the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="external">OpenStack project</a>.

<p>On most systems, the output from <code>git log</code> is run through a <em>pager</em>, an application that lets you scroll through a program's output in a user-friendly way.</p>
<p class="last">On my system, the pager is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix)" target="external">less</a>. You can quit <code>less</code> (or a similar but older tool called <code>more</code>), by typing "q", or control-C.</p>

<p>We can run the tests again and see that the new test got picked up, and ran successfully. To be extra-sure, lets use the <code>-v</code> flag to <code>pytest</code>, it will give us more detail about what tests were run:</p>

<p>Lets <code>git commit</code> our new test. We'll use the <code>-m</code> flag this time. This way, we can specify our commit log message on the command line, surrounded by double quotes (<code>"</code>). It's really handy for small changes like this.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p class="last">Be careful of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-bash/1565923472/ch01s09.html" target="external">special shell characters</a>, in messages you pass to the <code>-m</code> switch. If you have to use one, prefix it with a backslash (\).</p>
</div>
<p>First, lets check <code>git status</code> to make sure we know what we're committing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> git status
<span class="go">On branch master</span>
<span class="go">Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)</span>

<span class="go">Changes not staged for commit:</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)</span>

<span class="go">    modified:   src/random_quote/tests/test_wsgi.py</span>

<span class="go">Untracked files:</span>
<span class="go">  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)</span>

<span class="go">    quotes.csv</span>
<span class="go">    test.db</span>
<span class="go">    test_example.py</span>

<span class="go">no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that now, <code>git status</code> tells us that we are "ahead of 'orign/master' by 1 commit". That's letting us know we have commits that haven't been sent to the master (or <code>git push</code>) since we made our clone.</p>
<p>Ok, so we know what's going to be committed, lets do the commit:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> git commit -a -m<span class="s2">"Added web API test for a random quote"</span>
<span class="go">[master a110267] Added web API test for a random quote</span>
<span class="go"> 1 file changed, 11 insertions(+)</span>

<div class="section" id="let-s-publish-our-changes-git-push">
<h2 id="let's publish our changes (git push)">Let's Publish Our Changes (<code>git push</code>)</h2>
<p>Git is <em>decentralized</em>. There is a place where you got your copy of the code, this is referred to as a <em>remote</em>. Each clone, or <em>working copy</em> of the repository contains all of the changes since the repository was created. We work on our clone of the repository and can view and manipulate any change ever made. We work independently, in perpetuity.</p>
<p>In order for someone else to use those changes, we need to use send our commits to the remote. This is done via <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p>The default name for the default remote is <code>origin</code>. It's not necessary to specify it to <code>git push</code>, but it's a good habit to get into.</p>
<p>Lets push our changes to the <code>master</code> branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(random_quote)</span> <span class="gp">$</span> git push origin master
<span class="go">Enumerating objects: 20, done.</span>
<span class="go">Counting objects: 100% (20/20), done.</span>
<span class="go">Delta compression using up to 8 threads</span>
<span class="go">Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.</span>
<span class="go">Writing objects: 100% (13/13), 1.19 KiB | 1.19 MiB/s, done.</span>
<span class="go">Total 13 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0)</span>
<span class="go">To [...]/random_quote_remote</span>
<span class="go">   c670c79..a110267  master -&gt; master</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Before we did this, anyone else who cloned our repository would not be able to see the commits we made. Now that we have, they can run <code>git fetch</code> or <code>git pull</code> and retrieve the commits we made.</p>
