<p>I am a proud <strong>autodidact</strong>. That means I am <em>entirely</em> self taught. ü§î üéì ‚ù§Ô∏è People like myself are not uncommon in the tech industry, but we have always been in the minority. Autodidacts represent <em>industry outsiders</em>, because we've diverged from the typical learning path: a degree at a four-year college. With the advent of "let's code" initiatives, coding boot camps, better programming curriculum at 2-year colleges, and easier self-lead study, the number and varieties of outsiders is growing every day. We need to stick together.</p>
<p>We are a constant stream of new programmers, often without any sort of support system to help us along after we complete our training. Getting into this industry can be scary. So, for my fellow outsiders, I've put together some thoughts that will help you thrive and excel. I've based this on on what helped me, and my personal observations over the years.</p>
<p>However, I've realized that the difficulty of getting established is real, even for people with a typical education. There's a sort of <em>innocence</em> that is impressed onto new graduates, and there aren't a lot of resources for them either. So college grads, this is for you too.</p>

<p>A few years ago, inspired by the TV sitcom <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>, I fired up Adobe Illustrator and put together an infographic that highlights my personal philosophy about what makes a great software engineer, <em>The Johnson Pyramid Of Programmer Greatness</em>. This is the latest version.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll talk a bit in depth about how it came about, and what it all means.</p>

<p>In this part of the series, we'll apply what we've learned about state to our simple <a class="reference external" href="/circuitpython-state-part-1.html#testing">testing code from part one</a>.</p>
<p>Not only will we debounce some buttons <em>without blocking</em>, we'll use state to more efficiently control some LEDs.</p>
<p>We'll also explore what happens when state changes, and how we can take advantage of that to do even more complex things with very little code, using the magic of <em>event detection</em> üåà .</p>
<p>All of this will be done in an object-oriented fashion, so we'll learn a lot about OOP as we go along.</p>

<p>In this part of the series, we're going to really dig into what <em>state</em> actually is. We'll use analogies from real life, and then look at how we might model real-life state using Python data structures.</p>
<p>But first, we'll discuss a common problem that all budding electronics engineers have to deal with at some point: "noisy" buttons and how to make them "un-noisy", commonly referred to as "debouncing".</p>
<p>We'll talk about fixing the problem in the worst, but maybe easiest way: by <em>blocking</em>. We'll also talk about why it's bad.</p>

<p>This is the first article in a series that explores concepts of <em>state</em> in CircuitPython.</p>
<p>In this installment, we discuss the platform we're using (both CircuitPython and the Adafruit M0/M4 boards that support it), and build a simple circuit for demonstration purposes. We'll also talk a bit about <em>abstraction</em>.</p>
<p>This series is intended for people who are new to Python, programming, and/or microcontrollers, so there's an effort to explain things as thoroughly as possible. However, experience with basic Python would be helpful.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="/boot-getting-started-with-clojure-in-10-minutes.html">As covered in a previous post</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot">boot</a> is an all-around useful tool
for building clojure applications, but one feature in particular has
proven a <em>adjuncti finalum</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[*]</a> : boot lets you do <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/boot-clj/boot/wiki/Scripts">clojure scripting</a>. This
elevates clojure to the same high productivity of scripting languages
(like my personal favorite, Python), but bakes in dependency management
and other goodies. This allows the user to build complexity iteratively,
in a straight-forward manner (verses generating a bunch of boiler plate
project code and building a package). This article explores boot
scripting further, illustrating how boot can be used to quickly and
easily develop and distribute applications and tools. There's also
discussion about getting your jars into
<a class="reference external" href="http://clojars.org">Clojars</a>, and setting up a simple bare-minimum
<a class="reference external" href="http://maven.apache.org/index.html">Maven</a> repository.</p>
