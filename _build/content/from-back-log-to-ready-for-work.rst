I've been thinking a lot about the backlog grooming and design process
in Agile approaches like Scrum.

Something occurred to me recently: what I really want during this phase
is true driving out of assumptions. I want to discuss and record
implementation plans and discuss how we're going to accomplish a given
user story so that when we do estimation, it's realistic.

A big part of that is the intermediate products, or project assets as I
call them in the diagram - mockups, use cases, workflow (and other)
diagrams, and prototypes. Proof of concept at various levels coupled
with documenting the *how* of what we'll do in the next sprint.

This diagram hopes to put this process, as I see it, into focus more
directly than I think I could do through prose.

This is a mini-experiment of sorts - how much can I convey in a diagram
without a lot of verbiage to accompany it?

As such, thoughts and comments are welcome.
