In this tutorial, we'll build a *sound meter* using the never-boring `Circuit Playground Express <https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333>`__. Building on the `example in the CircuitPlayground Express docs <https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/playground-sound-meter>`__, we'll improve the overall performance in a few key ways, and use an event-driven approach based on state management.

In putting together `State And Events In CircuitPython <{filename}/pages/circuitpython-state.rst>`__ in 2018, I found myself in a bit of a quagmire. I initially wrote the series as one very, very long article early in the year, and as I broke things up, the scope of the series expanded quite a bit.

At the same time, "life stuff" got in the way, and I had to make some tough decisions about where I'd put my effort. As such, the series languished a bit. 

I did manage to synthesize what I had already written, along with what I had planned near-term into a presentation I gave to TriPython in December of 2018.

Overview
========

Our Inspiration
===============

Materials/Setup
===============

In contrast to previous posts this article is written directly for the CircuitPlayground Express. 

Because of this, the only materials you need to follow along are:

* A CircuitPlayground Express board.
* A micro-USB cable.
* A computer.

I'd highly suggest using the mu editor as well.

Update The Firmware
-------------------

This tutorial was written using CircuitPython ï»¿4.0.2. You should always use the latest available firmware.

.. note::
    
    Please contact the author if you have any trouble with later versions of CircuitPython.
