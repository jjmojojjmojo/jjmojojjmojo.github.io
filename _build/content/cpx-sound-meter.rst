I've run into a bit of a delay in finishing up the `State And Events In CircuitPython <{filename}/pages/circuitpython-state.rst>`__ series. In the meantime, I wanted to do a quick project using some of the concepts and the CPX. 

In this tutorial, we'll build a *sound meter* - using the microphone on the CircuitPlayground Express, we'll show relative sound intensity using the built-in Neopixels. We'll incorporate state and events along the way, and peek into analog signal processing.
