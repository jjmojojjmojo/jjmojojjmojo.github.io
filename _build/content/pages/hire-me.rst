*The short-short version*
=========================

I'm actively looking for work. Please poke around this site and look at the links below. If you have a position you think I might be a good fit for, please `reach out <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`__. I'm also on `LinkedIn <https://www.linkedin.com/in/jjmojojjmojo/>`__.

Here are my links:

* **Twitter:** `\@jjmojojjmojo <https://twitter.com/jjmojojjmojo>`__

* **Github:** https://github.com/jjmojojjmojo

I'm based in Palm Bay, FL. I am willing to relocate *anywhere*. I have previous experience working remote and on distributed teams, so remote positions are great too.

I'm not concerned with company size (see my goals below), however start-ups and nonprofits are particularly encouraged to reach out. |heart|

My Resume, Summarized
=====================
**I solve problems.** I've been doing this for a long time (I got my first paying job coding in 1999). I'm not tied to technology or development methodology. I use the tools I have to fix what's broken and bring value to my stake holders. What tools I don't have, I learn, *or make*. There's no shame in buying or delegating either! |cool| (*tools in this sense include tech, languages, platforms, as well as patterns, domain knowledge, and project management and methodology concepts*)

I've worked in a lot of languages over the years. I've also picked up many on the job.

Lets not get bogged down in what I *know*, lets talk about what I've *done*, what I can *learn*, and what I can *do*.

What I Want To Do
=================
**Real talk:** I want to be *useful*. That's my goal. I enjoy working on close-knit teams, but I'm self-directed and work well independently. The main thing is making an *impact*. Second to that, I want to learn new things, grow as an engineer, and do interesting work.

| "Interesting", to me, might be different than what it is for other people. For me it's about **agency**, its about **impact**. It can be boring work, or the drudgery of being on-call. If I'm able to add value, and have agency to improve the codebase and process as I do it, it's **extremely interesting to me**. |rainbow|

I'm open to out-of-the-box collections of responsibilities. I was once "The Gunslinger", working independently on high-risk, high-value projects. I often cross-train in other departments. I jump into help queues. I hang out with accountants and sales people. I do field work. *I break down barriers.*

I am eager to leverage my experience, love of collaboration, and attention to detail in unique and interesting ways.

For example: My resume may paint me as a "devop" or "programmer" but maybe what you really need is:

* A *user advocate*.
* A *cross-functional coordinator*.
* A *problem eliminator*.
* A *documentation scribe*.
* A *customer success accelerator*.
* A *software defect exterminator*.
* A *development culture ambassador*.

Let's work together to create a role where I can be the catalyst of everything your organization needs to be better. That's what I want to do. |sparkleheart|
