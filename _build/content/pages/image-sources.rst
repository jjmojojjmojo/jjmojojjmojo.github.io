Introduction
============
This file is a scratchpad for any images that I grabbed from someplace else. My goal is to make sure that I have proper clearance and permission to use anything that I didn't originate. So I'll keep a log here of what I grabbed, from where, and when. I'll log any available source info to give proper attribution.

.. tip::
   
   If you believe I have used your media in an inappropriate way, please `let me know <{filename}/pages/contact.rst>`__ and we'll work out the details.
