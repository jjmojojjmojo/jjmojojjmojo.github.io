&lt;p&gt;In this part of the series, we'll apply what we've learned about state to our simple &lt;a class="reference external" href="/circuitpython-state-part-1.html#testing"&gt;testing code from part one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will we debounce some buttons &lt;em&gt;without blocking&lt;/em&gt;, we'll use state to more efficiently control some LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll also explore what happens when state changes, and how we can take advantage of that to do even more complex things with very little code, using the magic of &lt;em&gt;event detection&lt;/em&gt; ðŸŒˆ .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this will be done in an object-oriented fashion, so we'll learn a lot about OOP as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part of the series, we're going to really dig into what &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; actually is. We'll use analogies from real life, and then look at how we might model real-life state using Python data structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, we'll discuss a common problem that all budding electronics engineers have to deal with at some point: "noisy" buttons and how to make them "un-noisy", commonly referred to as "debouncing".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll talk about fixing the problem in the worst, but maybe easiest way: by &lt;em&gt;blocking&lt;/em&gt;. We'll also talk about why it's bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first article in a series that explores concepts of &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; in CircuitPython.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this installment, we discuss the platform we're using (both CircuitPython and the Adafruit M0/M4 boards that support it), and build a simple circuit for demonstration purposes. We'll also talk a bit about &lt;em&gt;abstraction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series is intended for people who are new to Python, programming, and/or microcontrollers, so there's an effort to explain things as thoroughly as possible. However, experience with basic Python would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
