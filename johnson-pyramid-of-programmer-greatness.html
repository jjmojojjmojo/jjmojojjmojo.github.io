<p>A few years ago, inspired by the TV sitcom <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>, I fired up Adobe Illustrator and put together an infographic that highlights my personal philosophy about what makes a great software engineer, <em>The Johnson Pyramid Of Programmer Greatness</em>. This is the latest version.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll talk a bit in depth about how it came about, and what it all means.</p>

<p class="caption">Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) and Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), or, "what Josh's brain looks like inside".</p>
</div>
<p>There's a TV sitcom that aired on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC">NBC</a> in the US from 2009-2015 called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parks_and_Recreation">Parks and Recreation</a>. It's filmed in the style of a documentary, like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Office_(UK_TV_series)">The Office</a>, but they didn't take the format too literally.</p>
<p>The series centers around a parks and recreation department in a fictitious town in Indiana. The main character is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Knope">Leslie Knope</a>, a deputy director who believes in government and is really upbeat and motivated. She's played by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Poehler">Amy Poehler</a>.</p>
<p>Her boss is sort of her counterpart, a self-proclaimed "libertarian" who's biggest dream is to eliminate all government spending. His name is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Swanson">Ron Swanson</a>, and he's portrayed by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Offerman">Nick Offerman</a>.</p>
<p>While I've always enjoyed the show, these two characters, in particular, have always fascinated me. This is for a few reasons. First, they are very different people and yet get along really well. I love seeing that, it's reflective of really great relationships I've had, and it's something we sorely need more of in real life. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
<p>Second, they are both true individuals - they each march to the beat of their own drummer. I identify with that aspect, since I'm sort of weird too. ü¶Ñ</p>
<p>But more so, the two characters, in a small way, represent the dichotomy of my own personality.</p>
<p>Leslie is high energy, meticulous, and hyper-organized. She has strong, positive beliefs. I tend to be that way too. While technically a staunch realist, I tend to look at things in a positive light first, and find a lot of joy and wonder in the world.</p>
<p>Ron is a pragmatist at heart. He's blunt, and anti-social. He's an outdoorsman. A "mans-man" but not insensitive or bigoted. He does things his own way. Yet he will share his wisdom readily. He's a craftsman, and builds beautiful things without much celebration. I identify with Ron a lot when I'm building things, or mentoring.</p>
<p>That's me in a nutshell - optimistic and positive, bubbly, intensely excited about things I'm interested in. Yet I'm a quiet, matter-of-fact, pragmatic craftsman when I'm creating. Both sides of my personality work together when I'm sharing what I know, teaching, or writing documentation.</p>

<p>There was an episode where Ron was tasked with coaching a children's basketball team. Ron decided that the best way to make true champions of his kids was to indoctrinate them with wisdom of what makes a person truly great.</p>

<p class="caption">"Coach" Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) presenting <em>The Swanson Pyramid Of Greatness</em> to his team.</p>
</div>
<p>He presented them with an infographic entitled <em>The Swanson Pyramid Of Greatness</em>. In includes many true gems, real words to live by, such as:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>CAPITALISM</strong> God's way of determining who is smart, and who is poor.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>INTENSITY</strong> Give 100%. Giving 110% is impossible. Only idiots recommend that.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>BUFFETS</strong> Whenever available. Choose quantity over quality.</div>
</div>
<p>There's also a row that contains <strong>COW PROTEIN</strong>, <strong>PIG PROTEIN</strong>, <strong>CHICKEN PROTEIN</strong>, <strong>DEER PROTEIN</strong> along with <strong>ROMANTIC LOVE</strong> and <strong>FISH PROTEIN (SPORT ONLY!)</strong>. üòÄ</p>
<p>It's all very tongue-in-cheek, and a ridiculous thing to push onto kids just trying to get some exercise.</p>
<p>And that's what got me thinking - what sort of things would I put on such a pyramid, in a similar tongue-in-cheek style, that I might push on unsuspecting software engineers? I fired up Illustrator and got to work.</p>

<p>My interpretation of Ron Swanson's masterpiece is probably a little more serious than his was, but it's still intended to be a light-hearted take. It was designed in Adobe Illustrator, at full 24x48" poster size. I tweaked the dimensions a little bit to accommodate printing on standard letter/A4 paper, in landscape.</p>
<p>Since I was refreshing the illustration for posting to this new site, I also went ahead and freshened the color scheme as well (click on the images for the full-size version):</p>

<p>The original version used colors inspired by Ron's poster:</p>

<p>I've also made a black-and-white version for easier printing with black-and-white laser printers:</p>

<p>I've created PDF versions of each file, should you want to print in the best-possible quality:</p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
<p>In my pyramid, as in Ron's, the blocks of wisdom are arranged such that the least important concepts are lower on the pyramid. Now, you might argue that <strong>Caffeine</strong> is less important than <strong>Attention To Detail</strong>, and that's sort of the point. It's about the way <em>I</em> feel about things, and how <em>you</em> feel about things. It's designed to spark conversation. Like, maybe we should talk if <strong>Beer</strong> is higher on your list than, say <strong>Process</strong>... ü§î The idea is that we're "busting the collective chops" of myself and my colleagues, with a gentle nudge toward what I've found to be the most useful over the years. It's all meant in good fun. üíñ</p>
<p>That said, I think we will <strong>all</strong> agree that <strong>J.F.D.I.</strong> and <strong>Awesomeness</strong> are of ultimate (and penultimate) importance! üòâ</p>
