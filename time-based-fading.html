<p>Neopixels are small, but they are <em>extremely bright</em>. Staring at them in their raw glory can be headache inducing. This even happens at low brightness settings. <strong>You will see spots</strong>.</p>

</div>
<p>For the sake of your eyes, you will probably want to use some kind of <em>diffuser</em> as you walk through this tutorial, or in general when doing projects that use neopixels.</p>
<p>A diffuser will scatter the light and save your eyes. As an added bonus, it will help to blend the colors more effectively, giving an overall more "pure" tint to the colors, even with gamma correction (more on that later).</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of materials for inspiration. You might have one of these around your house (if not they are inexpensive and easy to find). Each one provides a increasing level of diffusion.</p>

<h2 id="neopixel fading: basics">Neopixel Fading: Basics</h2>
<p>To get ourselves oriented, lets start with the simplest possible fading loop. We'll take the neopixels from off to full red and then back again.</p>
<p>Colors on neopixels are specified as sequences of unsigned 8-bit values, one for each color: red, green and blue. This means we have a possible range of <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> to <code>(255, 255, 255)</code>.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p class="last">"8-bit" means a number that, if represented in binary, would be made up of 8 individual 1's and 0's. An <em>unsigned</em> 8-bit number will range from 0000000 to 1111111, or 0 to 255. If negative numbers were possible (if they were <em>signed</em>), the range would be -127 through 127 - one bit is used to represent the minus sign, so the actual range is 7 bits, 0000000 to 1111111 (the first bit is usually used to store 1 for negative, and 0 for positive)</p>
</div>
<p>To fade an RGB pixel from black (off) to red, we need to count from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>, and assign the value to the red element. We'll do the math on the fly.</p>

</div><p>You'll notice how smooth this is, but also how slow it is. This is the CircuitPlayground running at <em>full speed</em>. It doesn't mean the CircuitPlayground is slow, it's just that writing to neopixels takes a tiny fraction of a second in each loop. This is because writing to the neopixels is a <em>blocking</em> operation. Everything stops as we wait for the neopixels to update.</p>
<p>You may also notice that, as the color changes, it can be hard to tell the difference between  transitional shades of red. This is due to the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision#Wavelength_and_hue_detection_in_humans" target="external">relative sensitivity of your eyes to red wavelengths of light</a>, but also because the LED elements really can't produce as many specific shades of red as you're requesting.</p>
<p>We can overcome the issue of blocking and the length of the cycle initially by simply <em>shortening the cycle</em>! We can't really see all 255 shades of red, so lets reduce that number. How about we try 21(ish) shades instead?</p>

<p>😎 At this point we've got the basics of fading down. We know that we don't need a full cycle of colors to get a nice smooth result, our eyes aren't perfect, and that writing to neopixels is a <em>blocking</em> operation.</p>
<p>There's another issue we should touch on. Lets switch to a mix of colors (we'll mix red and green to make yellow), and slow down the fading so we can better see each color, and see what happens:</p>

</video>
</div><p>It may be hard to tell from the video, but if you're following along on your own board, you'll likely note that the 'yellow' color is actually quite green in hue. This is due to the way that the specific wavelengths of red and green light mix. We can get around this using a technique called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction" target="external">gamma correction</a>.</p>
<p>In simple terms, gamma correction is the application of a mathematical formula to a color value to adjust for the inherent limitations of the light source emitting the color (relative to the human eye). The details of it are fascinating, but out of scope for this tutorial. Fortunately, Adafruit has built a really killer CircuitPython library that has all sorts of useful tools for working with RGB LEDs, including gamma correction. It's called FancyLED, and it's amazing (it's a port of <a class="reference external" href="http://fastled.io/" target="external">FastLED</a>).</p>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p>A Quick Note About Brightness</p>
<p>Up until now, we've been using the <code>brightness</code> parameter to the NeoPixel constructor to control how bright we want the NeoPixels to be. We've been using the maximum value, <code>1.0</code>. We've been using a <em>constant</em>, named <code>BRIGHTNESS</code> to set that value.</p>
<p>The maximum value is super bright, like eye-pain-inducing bright (did you <a class="reference external" href="#detour-diy-diffusers-to-save-your-eyes">make a diffuser</a>?). It also draws a lot more power on average then using a lower brightness level. So we'll typically want to use a lower value in most projects.</p>
<p>However, when mixing colors with FancyLED, it's best to set the NeoPixel brightness to maximum, and let the FancyLED API know what brightness we want when calculating colors. This leads to the best looking colors overall.</p>
<p>From here on, we'll be setting <code>BRIGHTNESS</code> to <code>0.4</code> and passing <code>1.0</code> to <code>neopixel.NeoPixel()</code>. We've picked <code>0.4</code> because it is fairly bright, but not overly so. When brightness is low, the fidelity of the colors produced is a little lower as well.</p>
<p class="last">Feel free to use a different <code>BRIGHTNESS</code> level that's best for your comfort!</p>
</div>
<p>Lets use Fancy to gamma correct the yellow colors:</p>

</div><p>In the video, it may still look a little greenish, but in real life, the yellow is much more accurate.</p>
<p>Fancy provides a few key components for our color-correction purposes. First, the <code>CRGB</code> class encapsulates an RGB color sequence into an object with useful methods for color math. Those extra methods are used by the <code>gamma_adjust</code> function to do its magic. <code>gamma_adjust</code> returns another <code>CRGB</code> object.</p>
<p>When applying the color to our neopixels, we're using the <code>pack()</code> method. This method returns a single-value representation of the color sequence.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Note</h2>
<p>You can access the red, blue, and green elements individually to construct an RGB sequence, however, those values are stored internally as floats from 0 to 1, so they need to be converted:</p>

<li>it's more efficient - we're saving lines of code and memory here.</li>
<li>we're going to rely heavily on <code>pack</code>'s output later in this tutorial.</li>
</ul>

Here's what the code from the last section looks like taking full advantage of FancyLED's fanciness:</p>

</td></tr></table></div><p>The primary change here is using <code>expand_gradient()</code> instead of doing our own math to fade from one shade to the next. It takes a sequence where each member is a position as a float (the beginning of the gradient is <code>0.0</code> and the end is <code>1.0</code>) and a <code>CRGB</code> color object. It returns a sequence of new <code>CRGB</code> objects that we can pass to <code>gamma_ajust()</code>, in place of the tuples we used before.</p>

<div class="section" id="pre-calculated-gradients">
<h2 id="pre-calculated gradients">Pre-calculated Gradients</h2>
<p>There's an added benefit to using <code>expand_gradient()</code> as we are here: we can do all of this work <em>offline</em> instead of on the fly (or, <em>at runtime</em>). Colors are ultimately represented as integers and a palette is just a sequence. This means its possible to represent our ready-to-display fading color series as a simple tuple of integers. This is a boon for a couple of reasons, primarily memory-related ones:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tuples of integers are very compact since they are <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object" target="external">immutable</a> (once they are created, they cannot be changed, so they can be stored in a special way that is more memory efficient).</li>
<li>We don't have to ship the FancyLED library with our main application code, saving on flash memory.</li>
<li>We don't have to load FancyLED either, leaving more memory available for our  main code.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can refactor the code above into a function that will return a tuple of packed integers representing our gradient. While we're at it, we can figure out each position value with a little math (here we're assuming we want each color to be displayed for the same amount of time, check out <a class="reference external" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/fancyled-library-for-circuitpython/palettes" target="external">the FancyLED docs</a> for more).</p>
<p>We can then print the palette out to the console in a way that can be copy-and-pasted into our project, or another module. Finally, we'll display the gradient on the neopixels as before so we can see it in action:</p>

</td></tr></table></div><p>Lets briefly discuss the <code>make_gradient()</code> function.</p>
<p><code>make_gradient()</code> takes three parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code>colors</code>, a sequence of <code>CRGB</code> objects.</li>
<li><code>count</code>, an integer that sets how many colors to generate.</li>
<li><code>cycle</code>, a boolean. Controls if the gradient should abruptly end or fade back into itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>count</code> parameter sets the granularity of the gradient - a higher <code>count</code> means a smoother transition.</p>
<p>You'll want to adjust the <code>count</code> to suit your memory requirements and the speed of your animation. You can get a pretty good result with as few as 5 or 10 generated colors if they are displayed quickly enough.</p>
<p><code>cycle</code>'s value depends on the effect you are trying to achieve. Most of the code we've looked at so far fades a color in, then fades it out again. Our pride color fader above keeps cycling smoothly. But there are times when we want a color to simply fade out, or a sequence to dazzle the user and then return to a solid color. In that case, we can set <code>cycle</code> to <code>False</code>.</p>

<h3>When <em>Not</em> To Precalculate</h3>
<p>As noted above, we can save a lot of memory and overhead by pre-calculating our gradients. But sometimes it's not the best approach. In particular:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>When memory is at a premium.</strong> In memory-starved environments, doing calculations inline can be more efficient than storing a pre-calculated pallete. In these situations you would want to look at the FancyLED source and port over the gamma correction algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>When you need a lot of gradients.</strong> Even on "beefy" platforms like our CPX/CPB boards, having a lot of pre-calculated gradients will take up precious memory.</li>
<li><strong>When you need a really slow, really smooth animation</strong> The gradients get bigger and bigger as you generate more and more intermediate colors. You can easily run out of memory working with longer, smoother gradients.</li>
<li><strong>When the duration or color scheme of the gradient animation is variable.</strong> If the rate of the fade,  or the colors used, will change in a dynamic or highly variable way, doing the calculations at runtime will yield a better result. You can compromise, if you have the memory, and generate the same gradient for multiple durations and color combinations (we'll be using this technique later on).</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p>If you <em>are</em> doing on-the-fly calculations, Fancy provides a <code>mix()</code> function, that will return the color in-between two <code>CRGB</code> colors.</p>
<p>Here's a quick example, re-implementing the ominous red gradient from the beginning of the tutorial, but using <code>mix()</code> instead of doing the math ourselves, or using <code>expand_gradient()</code>.</p>

<p>Up until now, we've been fading our neopixels in our main <code>while True</code> loop. It does the job, but there are some rough edges. Lets prepare to smooth them out by encapsulating our fading logic into a <em>class</em>. This way, we can do some very interesting things in the near future (hold tight, it's going to be great!).</p>

</td></tr></table></div><p>We've used a couple of notable Python features in our <code>LoopFader</code> class:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We've established a <em>constructor</em> method. These are always named <code>__init__</code> in Python. We use this method to set up the basic state of our class: set the palette, and set the initial color index. Constructors can take parameters like any other method. We use that to get a hold of the gradient, via the <code>palette</code> parameter, and save a reference to it.</li>
<li>We're using a <em>decorator</em>, called <code>@property</code>. Decorators allow you to annotate an object with code that enhances its functionality. <code>@property</code> is a special built-in decorator that transforms a method (in our case <code>color()</code>) into an object attribute. Normally, you'd have a static value for the current color, and when you access it, it would always be the same. Using this decorator, we've created a dynamic attribute! Every time you access <code>fader.color</code>, the <code>color()</code> method is called, and it returns the next color in the gradient.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition tip">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Tip</h2>
<p class="last">If you'd like to dig into everything Python classes have to offer, check out <a class="reference external" href="http://introtopython.org/classes.html" target="external">Introduction To Python: Classes</a>! 🎓</p>
</div>
<p>After the major changes (refactoring the code into a class, using the decorator), the next thing you might notice about this code is that we aren't updating the neopixels after we select the next color in our gradient. This is a concept called <em>separation of concerns</em>. What it boils down to is keeping the functionality of any piece of code (class, function, method) as limited as possible, and establishing boundaries between different parts of your application.</p>
<p>Here, we're separating a hardware API from our fading logic. The utility of this will become more apparent in the next example.</p>
<p>So at this point you may be wondering what the point of moving the code around was. We're doing exactly the same thing, but now the code is spread out over the file. What's the benefit? 🤔</p>
<p>Consider that we may want to use different gradients, or fade in different sequences <em>per pixel</em>.</p>
<p>Because we've encapsulated the fading logic in a class, we can stamp out different instances of that class, each with different attributes. Each different instance can be used for a different purpose, or <em>use case</em>.</p>
<p>This leads to much cleaner code, some memory efficiency, and <em>ease of reuse</em>. We can take this <code>LoopFader</code> class and put it into a module and use it in future projects without copy/paste. We can e-mail it to a friend, or put in version control. The foundation class never has to change.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Note</h2>
<p class="last">There are a ton of other advantages to using classes. We can even override parts of a class and give the same methods or attributes new meaning. For a quick example of this, called <em>polymorphism</em> (aka class inheritance), see <a class="reference internal" href="#enhancement-a-fader-with-a-mode">Enhancement: A Fader With A Mode</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a wacky example showing how we can control individual neopixels in different ways using the same code, since we've encapsulated it into a class:</p>

</div><p>Wow, so now we have control of fading on a per-pixel basis! This would be an order of magnitude more complex if we had written this without using a class. Next, lets refine how we do our fading animation to make it more efficient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fading-class-2-looping-without-blocking">
<h2 id="fading class #2: looping without blocking">Fading Class #2: Looping Without Blocking</h2>
<p>There are two blocking operations in the previous code. The first is writing to the neopixels. We can't do much, if anything about this. The other blocking operation is the call to <code>time.sleep()</code>, that we've added to slow things down. This, we can do something about.</p>
<p>The trick here is to use a non-blocking operation to track the passage of time, and then only move the color index forward if the correct amount of time (this case, <code>0.1</code> seconds) has passed.</p>
<p>On other embedded platforms, we have access to what are known as <em>timer interrupts</em> - sort of like digital stop watches that will run code at a given interval. CircuitPython doesn't currently implement these for us, so we have to use a different tact, and check the time every loop, or <em>poll</em> the clock.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Note</h2>
<p class="last">Polling the clock like this is a great technique to learn! It's useful for any sort of time-based action, including filtering digital input readings. For a deep-deep dive into that subject, see <a class="reference external" href="/pages/circuitpython-state.html">State And Events In CircuitPython</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>Microcontrollers don't normally have a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock" target="external">"real time clock"</a>, like most computers do, so other ways of tracking the passage of time are used. The details aren't super important, just know that a real-time clock will keep consistent time from "tick" to "tick", but the other mechanisms that might be used are tied to the <em>clock cycle</em> of the microcontroller, and can "drift". A second on a stopwatch might not match up exactly with a second of time on your CircuitPlayground (but it'll be pretty darn close!).</p>
<p>Anyway, CircuitPython gives us a special function that gives us a time reference we can count on to always be constantly increasing, called <code>time.monotonic()</code>. To illustrate its use, lets count the number of times the main <code>while True</code> loop runs:</p>

</div><p>On my board, the while loop is running about 8000 times every second. Not bad.</p>
<p>You will notice that the exact count is different every time - this is what I was referring to above. Its consistent, but imprecise, so it's not a great way to keep time. Luckily, for fading neopixels we just need to track short periods of time passing, so that drift will be of little consequence.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Note</h2>
<p>You may be thinking, "Wait, isn't the processor in the CPX (ATSAMD21) clocked at like, 48 <em>megahertz</em>? Shouldn't the loop run 48 <em>million times per second</em>?!"</p>
<p class="last">Remember that CircuitPython adds a lot of overhead on top of the raw power of the processor. Python is an interpreted language - your code isn't translated directly to instructions the processor can execute so there are a couple of levels of abstraction at play to make the processor do what we want. Those layers eat up some clock cycles every loop.</p>
</div>
<p>We can check for just about any amount of time elapsing, down to around a hundredth (<code>0.01</code>) of a second. The precision of <code>time.monotonic()</code> will vary a bit depending on the processor, so you may be able to get finer precision, or you may not be able to get better than a <em>tenth</em> (<code>0.1</code>) of a second.</p>
<p>Now we can track the passage of time, and detect that a given period has elapsed. Once we've determined that a period of time has elapsed, we can take action. In the case of our <code>LoopFader</code> class, we can advance the counter that tracks which color in the gradient we are currently displaying.</p>
<p>Here's the fading code from the last section refactored to use <code>time.monotonic()</code> instead of <code>time.sleep()</code>:</p>

</td></tr></table></div><p>We have significantly increased the overall speed of our code. Before, we were locked into one loop every <code>0.1</code> seconds. While <code>time.sleep()</code> is running, nothing else can happen. With this minor change, we're no longer stopping all activity. This means that we won't get in the way of other actions, like updating the neopixels, reading inputs, or writing to other outputs. This makes our project more responsive. 😎</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-more-thing-a-minor-reduction-in-blocking">
<h2 id="one more thing! (a minor reduction in blocking)">One More Thing! (A Minor Reduction In Blocking)</h2>
<p>Remember earlier when I said that writing to the neopixels was blocking, and there wasn't much we could do about it? Well, there is one minor thing we can do that can ensure we're blocking as little as possible.</p>
<p>In all of our code so far, we've been writing to the neopixels with every iteration of our main <cite>while</cite> loop. However, we're only changing the color every <cite>0.1</cite> seconds. We saw earlier that, on my board, the loop runs ~8000 times every second. That's 8000 writes to the neopixels every second as well. Every write takes a tiny fraction of a second. Just like with our fading code, this blocking means that other things can't happen.</p>
<p>In our current application, it's not really noticeable, but as we add features it can become a big problem.</p>
<p>This is an easy thing to fix. First, we'll refactor the <code>LoopFader()</code> so the <code>color</code> attribute is no longer being updated every time it's accessed. Then, we'll move the updating logic into another method, <code>update()</code>. Finally, we'll call <code>update()</code> every cycle, and (here's the secret sauce) <strong>only write to the neopixels when the color has changed</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="fading end game: time-based fading with dropped frames">Fading End Game: Time-based Fading With Dropped Frames</h2>
<p>We've got a pretty great algorithm for fading our neopixels from one color to the next. We're pre-calculating the gradient values, and changing colors over time without blocking. We have a pretty slick, smooth animation!</p>
<p>However, our <code>LoopFader</code> class has to have its <code>update()</code> method called to move to the next color in the gradient. If anything prevents that, like blocking code, the gradient will take longer to complete. In other words, it will appear to slow down, and can even look choppy.</p>
<p>Lets add some artifical blocking with <code>time.sleep()</code> to see what this looks like:</p>

</div><p>The choppiness here is very regular, because our blocking is very regular. In practice, it will look more like a random stutter.</p>
<p>How can we prevent this? Well, we can <em>drop frames</em>. Essentially, we can skip colors if our <code>update()</code> method isn't run fast enough for our needs.</p>
<p>Since we have a finite number of colors we want to cycle through, and a specific time in which to complete the cycle, we can use some math to decide which color should be displayed at a given moment based on the time that has elapsed since the cycle was started.</p>
<p>Here's our endgame: a non-blocking gradient loop that will always run in the desired time interval, even if other code gets in the way!</p>

</div><p>The take away from this is that by dropping frames, we can get a pretty good approximation of the intended gradient, even if code has to block.</p>

<div class="section" id="enhancement-a-fader-with-a-mode">
<h2 id="enhancement: a fader with a mode">Enhancement: A Fader With A Mode</h2>
<p>Now that we're finished, let's build up some new functionality to illustrate how useful this approach is.</p>
<p>Consider the following use cases:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Neopixels are <em>bright</em>, and use a lot of power, it might be useful for the user to be able to turn off the pixels. It might not just be through user interaction; it could be that we turn the pixels on or off depending on the ambient light, or input from a relay, etc.</li>
<li>Sometimes you just want to turn on a neopixel, and then turn it off. But when you turn it off, it can be nice to do a gentle fade.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both use cases share a common functionality: the concept of "mode". In either case, the fader can be "on" or "off".</p>
<p>Case #2 is a great case for using a gradient that doesn't "wrap".</p>
<p>Let's cover both use cases! We'll set up the two built-in buttons on our CircuitPlayground. The B button will turn a cycling gradient on and off. The A button will run a slow fade from a solid color to black and then automatically turn off.</p>
<p>We'll borrow an input handling class, <code>Button</code> from <a class="reference external" href="/pages/circuitpython-state.html">State And Events In CircuitPython</a>. You can ignore the details of that class for now.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<h2 class="first admonition-title">Note</h2>
<p>For a deep dive into how <code>Button</code> was built, check out <a class="reference external" href="/pages/circuitpython-state.html">State And Events In CircuitPython</a></p>
<p class="last">Generally speaking, we do something similar with <code>Button</code> that we do with <code>Fader</code>: we decide if the button has been pressed by tracking the passage of time, and triggering a function when we've detected a button action (press or release). This prevents noisy signals that would cause problems with reading the state of the buttons.</p>

<p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
          a <a href="/videos/time-based-fading/0013-fader-with-a-mode-demo.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
</div><p>In this example, we've taken advantage of a feature of classes called <em>inheritance</em> (related to the concept of <em>polymorphism</em>). We are able to reuse code in other classes by <em>extending</em> one class in another. This makes our code shorter.</p>
<p>We take our base <code>Fader</code> class and enhance it by adding an on/off mode, and setting the color to <code>0</code> when the fader is turned off (<code>ModeFader</code>)</p>
<p>We then extend the <code>ModeFader</code> class as <code>AutoOffFader</code>, automatically changing the mode to off when the gradient has completed one cycle. We add a new method called <code>reset()</code> to allow us to reset the state so the <code>AutoOffFader</code> object can do another cycle the next time the button is pressed.</p>
<p>The major change we had to make to previous code was adding an attribute called <code>index</code> to the <code>Fader</code> class. This attribute tracks the <em>index</em> of the current color in the palette. Previously, we only used that value temporarily in the <code>update()</code> method. Now that the attribute is tracked, the <code>AutoOffFader</code> class can detect when we've hit the end of the palette, so it knows when change modes to "off". This makes it possible to leave all the color selection logic in the <code>Fader.update()</code> method.</p>

<h2 id="appendix 1: application: switching gradients">Appendix 1: Application: Switching Gradients</h2>
<p>We've got all the pieces in place, lets build something that is <em>almost</em> a useful project. In doing so, we'll demonstrate how you can use pre-calculated gradients to provide functionality that lets a user set their preferences. The basic concepts here can be adapted to any project using a fading neopixel animation.</p>
<p>We'll build the following features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>You can turn the neopixels on or off using the slider switch.</li>
<li>You can cycle through a few pre-calculated gradients by pressing the A button.</li>
<li>You can cycle through 6 levels of dimming by pressing the B button.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time around, we'll break up our code into separate <em>modules</em> to make things a bit easier to follow.</p>
<p>First, the button and switch code. On your CircuitPython board, save the following as <code>button.py</code>:</p>

<p>If you want to use something besides the CPX or CPB for your projects, or if you want to use more (or less) neopixels, you will need to wire them up yourself.</p>
<p>For complete instructions, see <a class="reference external" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide" target="external">The Neopixel &Uuml;berguide</a>, especially the part about <a class="reference external" href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/powering-neopixels" target="external">powering neopixels</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we just want to show a basic wiring setup and what code changes will be needed.</p>

<p>Lets take a look at a breadboard, featuring an <a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727" target="external">Adafruit ItsyBitsy M0 Express</a>, and a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2862" target="external">24 NexoPixel ring featuring a fourth pure white pixel</a>.</p>
<p>Since the itsybitsy doesn't have any built-in buttons, we've added two momentary switches.</p>

<p>It's all pretty straight forward if you've worked with breadboards before. We've wired up the grey button via the white wire to pin D11, the yellow button via the yellow wire to pin D7, and the data pin of the neopixel strip to D5.</p>

<h3>Code Changes</h3>
<p>Here, we have the code from <a class="reference internal" href="#enhancement-a-fader-with-a-mode">Enhancement: A Fader With A Mode</a> above, modified to use the circuit above, and the modules we created in <a class="reference internal" href="#appendix-1-application-switching-gradients">Appendix 1: Application: Switching Gradients</a>.</p>
<p>FIrst, lets slightly alter <code>button.py</code> to use the correct pull <em>up</em> resistor:</p>

<li>Importing classes and colors from modules we created.</li>
<li>Using a single member of the gradients (we've picked level 2, feel free to use whatever brightness level you want)</li>
<li>Using a different pin for the neopixels (<code>D5</code> instead of the playground-specific <code>NEOPIXEL</code> alias)</li>
<li>Specifying the <code>pixel_order</code> when creating our <code>Neopixel</code> object. This is important, since our neopixel ring has <em>four</em> elements instead of three.</li>

<h2 id="appendix 3: a bunch of pre-calculated gradients for your enjoyment!">Appendix 3: A Bunch Of Pre-Calculated Gradients For Your Enjoyment!</h2>
<p>It can be a bit daunting to pre-calculate your gradients if you are new to python, so a small library of fun gradients have been provided to get you up and running quickly.</p>
<p>Each gradient has been generated at 6 different levels, and in sequences of 10, 16, and 24 steps.</p>
<p>You'll note a lot of the gradients are holiday-themed. This is because this fading code grew out of a project I did - I made macropads for my coworkers out of the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/4319" target="external">Adafruit PyRuler</a>. I decided to animate the onboard dotstar in a Christmas theme (red, green, white). I came up with a small suite of holiday and general purpose gradients so they could change thing easily and use their gift all year round.</p>
<div class="section" id="code-to-generate-the-gradients">
<h3>Code To Generate The Gradients</h3>
<p>The gradients provided below were produced using the following script. This builds on what we've done already: uses our <code>make_gradient()</code> function to print out a suite of colors defined in a dictionary called <code>gradients</code>. Each member of that dictionary is a sequence of <code>(gradient, wrap)</code>, indicating the colors to use, and if the gradient should wrap around or not. It cycles through brightness levels listed in <code>DIM_LEVELS</code>, and generates the number of colors for each level specified in <code>COLORS</code>.</p>
<p>It then prints each gradient out to the console in a way that can be easily copy/pasted, and finally loops through each generated gradient every 4 seconds, displaying it on the neopixels for inspection.</p>

<h3>Anna Howard Shaw</h3>
<p>A nod to an episode of a favorite TV comedy of mine, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Howard_Shaw_Day" target="external">30 Rock</a>. The main character, Liz Lemon, chooses to celebrate the birthday of pioneering suffragette and physician Anna Howard Shaw, instead of St. Valentine's day. A blend of red, white and pink to reflect the holiday (whichever you choose to celebrate!)</p>
