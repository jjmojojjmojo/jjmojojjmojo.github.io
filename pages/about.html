<p>This website is a creative outlet of <strong>Josh Johnson</strong>: writer, programmer, technology enthusiast... and ðŸ¦„ <em>iconoclast</em> ðŸ¦„?</p>
<p>This site contains articles, tutorials and light-hearted philosophical ramblings. It's generally geared toward other tech enthusiasts, but Josh tries to write for everyone. The tone is generally light, but <em>thorough</em>. Brevity is not Josh's strongest suit. Subjects typically revolve around technology, but may veer into other territories.</p>

</div>
<p>My name is Josh Johnson. I've been involved in tech professionally since 1999, and had my fair share of dabbling prior to that.</p>
<p>I have extensive experience with programming (Python, PHP, Perl, Javascript, Clojure), particularly web programming, systems automation, systems engineering, development and deployment pipelines (aka DevOps) and general technology.</p>
<p>I really enjoy programming. I am a big fan functional paradigms, but embraced OOP very early on in my journey, so it's second nature.</p>
<p>I'm big on aesthetics. My style tends to be minimalistic, but I like colors and patterns. When it comes to my work, I know how to make things look nice. I am comfortable with creative tools. I'm well versed with commercial and open-source tools (I know most of the Adobe suite well, can do great things with MS Office, but I also know The Gimp, Inkscape, and LibreOffice).</p>
<p>I don't believe anything is beyond my understanding. If I want to do something <em>it happens</em>. If I don't have a skill, <em>I will develop it</em>. I'm an autodidact, so I've been doing this my entire life. I've built my career on technologies that I had to learn, often on the fly, on a deadline. But where I differ from a lot of my self-taught colleagues is that I can't live with just a superficial understanding. I have an innate need to dig deeper, to know more. More is never enough.</p>
<p>I conduct myself in a methodical fashion. I work deliberately. I like organization. I've studied many development methodologies like SCRUM, and have really embraced the idea of planning <em>just enough</em> to be able to build working software.</p>
<p>When I'm not doing tech stuff, I love nature and art and all sorts of soft squishy things. ðŸ’– I'm very tactile. I also enjoy music; my tastes are varied, sometimes esoteric, but vast - there's probably some artist we both like.</p>
<p>I like to <em>make</em> things. I have a few recipes I know well. I craft, I paint, I assist my wife in her art photography. I build things with microcontrollers.</p>
<p>Overall I just really enjoy the things I do. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. ðŸ¤”.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-site">About The Site</h2>
<div class="section" id="philosophy">
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>This site's goals include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Providing high-quality content.</li>
<li>Making content useful to as many people as possible. This means the site should be responsive, as light-weight as possible, and accessible.</li>
<li>Looking good without detracting from the first two goals.</li>
<li>Serving a wide audience while being as cost-effective as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I really want the site to go against the grain of typical blogs. I want to find the "holy grail" of having a widely popular site that doesn't have to resort to intrusive ads, sponsored content, or any other revenue streams that tend to bum users out.</p>
<p>I also don't want you to have to log in to read something, or break your browser.</p>
<p>Further, I don't want my content to be beholden to some company. I want to be able to deploy it freely so I can change hosts at will as I need to scale.</p>
<p>This is a creative outlet for me, so I don't mind paying to keep it up - it's just tough when I see content becoming less and less useful as the userbase of a site goes up and up. And content producers make less and less money! I think its possible to be popular, maintain a high level of usability, and not have to constantly be strapped for cash.</p>
<p>So to start, this site, at its core, will always be strictly static. I've worked with many CMS systems over the years (<a class="reference external" href="https://plone.org/">Plone</a> is still my favorite), and find them all useless for a blog like mine.</p>
<p>The content is maintained as lightweight markup that is processed into static HTML for deployment (more about this below). This is the fundamental aspect of the site that will allow all of the goals to be achieved. Starting with lightweight markup means the code can live in a git repo, which keeps it autonomous. I can host my git repo on github (as I do currently), or I can host it in my own infrastructure.</p>
<p>Because it's all static, I don't require any scripting runtimes or platforms for my site to function - I can host it literally anywhere, and even in multiple places. Free hosting, paid hosting, self hosting in S3, or all of the above with a load balancer attached to my domain name, even multiple domain names - <em>it doesn't matter because it's static</em>.</p>
<p>That relieves a huge cost, compared to hosting a dynamic blog. Using lightweight markup means I can change the look and feel easily, and have that consistency in the way the content is presented, much like a CMS. It's the best of all worlds.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>This site has a few user features that are designed to enhance the overall utility of the site.</p>
<p>First, I've added "explanation" sections liberally throughout the site. They look like this:</p>
<div class="explanation section">
<h4>Explanation</h4>
<div class="docutils container">
</div>
<p>This part explains some stuff.</p>
</div>
<p>The book icon <object class="align-middle" data="/images/book-open.svg" type="image/svg+xml">OPEN_BOOK_ICON</object> is clickable - if you click it, the explanation is hidden. You can click the <object class="align-middle" data="/images/book.svg" type="image/svg+xml">CLOSED_BOOK_ICON</object> icon to open it back up.</p>
<p>The state of each explanation is stored in your browser, if its supported. You can control the data stored, as well as close or open all explanations on the <a class="reference external" href="/pages/settings.html">settings page</a>. You can get there quickly on any page in the site by clicking the gear icon in the right side of the header.</p>
<p>Code samples are syntax-highlighted for easier readability. They are rendered using my favorite terminal font, <a class="reference external" href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>. Here's an example of some random code:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">some_function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">**</span><span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arg2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">key</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">: </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">"</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">kwargs</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">key</span><span class="p">]))</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table><p>If you would like to use different colors for the highlighting, you can also change the style sheet over in the <a class="reference external" href="/pages/settings.html">settings page</a>.</p>
<div class="admonition tip">

<p class="last">Please <a class="reference external" href="/pages/contact.html">let me know</a> if you have any trouble with the code examples, especially with regards to the font choice or syntax highlighting.
