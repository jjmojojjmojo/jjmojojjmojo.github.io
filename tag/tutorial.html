<p>In this part of the series, we're going to really dig into what <em>state</em> actually is. We'll use analogies from real life, and then look at how we might model real-life state using Python data structures. Then, we'll use what we've learned to go further, tracking changes in state as <em>events</em> that we can respond to with code.</p>
<p>But first, we'll discuss a common problem that all budding electronics engineers have to deal with at some point: "noisy" buttons and how to make them "un-noisy", commonly referred to as "debouncing".</p>
<p>We'll talk about how to fix the problem with blocking (and what blocking is, and why its bad).</p>
<p>We'll use debouncing as a backdrop to apply what we're learning about state and events, by solving the problem <em>without blocking</em>.</p>

<p>This is the first article in a series that explores concepts of <em>state</em> in CircuitPython.</p>
<p>In this installment, we discuss the platform we're using (both CircuitPython and the Adafruit M0/M4 boards that support it), and build a simple circuit for demonstration purposes. We'll also talk a bit about <em>abstraction</em>.</p>
<p>This series is intended for people who are new to Python, programming, and/or microcontrollers, so there's an effort to explain things as thoroughly as possible. However, experience with basic Python would be helpful.</p>
